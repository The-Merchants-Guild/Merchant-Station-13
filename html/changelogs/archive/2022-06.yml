  EtraIV:
  - balance: Due to the sudden uptick in demand, the price on surplus crates has been
      reinflated.
2022-06-06:
  EtraIV:
  - bugfix: Point vendors no longer bluescreen when used with an ID card without an
      account.
  - rscdel: Point vendors are no longer interactable with tools. Necessary bandaid
      fix for a later fleshing out internally
  karmaisblackandbluepilled:
  - rscadd: Added new items that are only found in surplus crates. Get them while
      they're hot.
  - rscadd: Added the Supermatter Spear. Not good.
  - bugfix: Can't get to CC from the deathmatch map. Also removed the singularity/tesla
      from OSHA violator for obvious reasons.

  EtraIV:
  - balance: Plastic bottles can now be used in chemical grenades.
  - bugfix: Alternate reagent containers now work in large grenades again.

      it generated runtime errors)
  NonCoderAlias:

  karmaisblackandbluepilled:

2022-06-08:
  MACIEKBAKI:
  - code_imp: ERT code has been changed, check PR for details if you care.
  - admin: Entirely redone ERT spawning menu. New and improved. You can now choose
      to spawn an ERT with their pre-assigned mechs (i.e. a Deathsquad might spawn
      with Death Ripleys, Code Red ERT with marauders/seraphs, etc
  karmaisblackandbluepilled:
  - rscadd: Added the waddle quirk, put a little pep in your step.
  - rscadd: Added the technobabble emote, with special sounds for anyone wearing NERD
      suits.
  - balance: Both screaming and the technobabble emote deal oxygen damage now, to
      prevent you from spamming them. On the upside, if you do spam screaming the
      sounds can overlap.
