	1. Need to hunt and kill targets. These are chosen through your blood orb by your master, or by you if you are unbound.\
	2. Can warp out of reality to move faster and through walls, but you can only warp back into reality near your target or blood orb!\
	3. Are most likely bound by a binding rite. While your orb is filled with blood from your master, you cannot attack them.\
	4. Can choose targets for yourself only if you do not have an active master or binding rite, or there is no blood currently sacrificed by them.\
	5. Passively regenerate health while shifted out of the mortal reality, at the cost of sacrificed blood and blood gained from attacking people\
	6. Gain blood and some health back by attacking people. Attacking the same person multiple times increases the chance of a special attack.\
	7. Lose health and movespeed while not near your orb or your target. Always be on the hunt!\
	8. Die, if your orb is destroyed."))
